# RetroMeet

RetroMeet is a free, open-source dating and friend-finding application. RetroMeet has a philosophy of giving more space to give more information about yourself and to help find people who share common interests with you. The whole philosophy of RetroMeet is described in [the philosophy](docs/the_philosphy.md).

This repository contains the RetroMeet core. This component provides an API to access the app functionalities without any external interface.

## Development

RetroMeet is written in Ruby. More details on how to set up a development environment coming soon.
