# The Philosophy

We believe online dating is a thing and won't go away anytime soon. However, we also think there are problems with online dating nowadays: since the main apps are looking for profit, they are interested in keeping people on a loop of coming back to the app, making people spend energy on dates that might not go anywhere and on repeated conversations.

We think that online dating can be better and more accommodating of different profiles of people, so RetroMeet adheres to the following ideas:
- Try to cater to people looking for different things: people looking for life partnerships, polyamorous relationships, casual sex, etc.
- Avoid any kind of gamification of the whole date experience.
- Make algorithms as clear as possible and let people choose if they want to use them or not.
- Be as privacy-aware as possible, providing multiple levels of disclosure.
